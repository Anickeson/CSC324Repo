Avacado Prices Dataset Individual Project

--Basic Documentation--
The purpose of this project is simply to allow users to indulge their
curiousity and explore some of the relationships present in the data.
The data used in this visualization came from the Hass Avocado Board website
and was compiled into a single csv file. The Board collected retail scan data
from associated grocery stores from many different regions around the country.
As a consequence of gathering from the Hass Avocado Board website, the data set 
only concerns hass avocados.
This visualization is aimed at anybody interested in avocados and wants to
explore sales differences across a variety of different attributes seen within
the.
Starting this project I primarily wanted to see what the sales differences
would be between different PLUs of avocadoes. After laying out the charts it
was quite easy to spot the major differences. It would be more obvious if the
data was overlaid on the same chart. This could be achieved through some more
data manipulation, but could also potentially make the chart busy and hard to
read.

--Sales Visualization--
A visualization of sales quantities differentiated by differing factors such
as plu or bag size.

--Prices Visualization--
This Visualization provides an idea of how volatile avocado prices have been
on average over the duration of the data collection period.

--Data Table--
Gives the user an opportunity to see the data collected and it's format.

--Word Cloud--
This wordcloud is just an opportunity for the user to see the regions in which
the data was collected in an accessible and fun way.

--Needs Improvement--
Their are definitely other ways to communicate relationships within the data
which allows for comparisons to be more easily made. The line plot with
surrounding points allows for one to get a good sense of what's going on
with one relationship, but does not make comparison easy.
