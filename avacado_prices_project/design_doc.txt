Avacado Prices Dataset Individual Project

--Maps--
We have a lot of regions and it could be interesting to compare prices and
sales in different regions on a map. However, some of the regions are just
specific cities and some are super general like regions of the us. Like the
south or the west. Which is hard to visualize.
Could be more effectively compared with like histograms or something like that. The
maps idea could be out of the question. I'd have to assign a distinct
geographical region to each name and that would give me too much discretion on
interpreting the data. The south to me could be something completely different
than what the author thought.
I think I may try to separate the regions from teh cities just so that I can
compare them separately. Each one has a lot of data it seems.

--Avacado Sales Differentiated by PLU-
This one could be visualized in several different ways. Might still be best to
do it with a histogram, but I don't want my project to be primarily
histograms.

--Aggregate Avacado Sales Differentiated over time--
This one could easily be accomplished through a nice line chart. I could even
potentially add in three lines to compare how each plu contributes to the
total over time. That could be a cool visualization.

--Avacado Prices Distinguished over time--
Could also do Avacado Prices over time, we have that data too. This could be
made even more interesting if we threw in some general region data. I could
divide up the different regions and put them in just like a general North,
South, West, Central, East regional type of system. That would be up to my
discretion, I could include that information in a key somewhere too. That
would allow me to not cut out cities like Albany and instead include them in
the regional vis from the get go.
